## Configuring the Project

### Configuring server

Before all, you need to config the API options from Twitch and Giphy.

Create a environment variables file (.env) indentical to [file example](.env.example) and modify the informations according to the values below:

- **TWITCH_USERNAME**, your username or your bot's
- **TWITCH_TOKEN**, you can get from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
- **TWITCH_CHAT_CHANNEL**, normally is the same as your username
- **GIPHY_RATING**, accept only the values 'y' | 'g' | 'pg' | 'pg-13' | 'r'
- **GIPHY_TOKEN**, you can get from https://developers.giphy.com/

With this config, when the chatbot be implemented on a service like aws, netlify or other plataform, it will be only necessary to define this values on the plataform. 

### Configuring exhibition

To customize the exhibition, go to file `client/index.html` and search for:

- It's not necessary to provide all the options, because they all have a default value

```html
<script>
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    const options = {
      duration_default: 4, // Optional: value in seconds (default value is 4)
      duration_sub: 8, // Optional: value in seconds to subs (default value is 8)
      max_queue: 10, // Optional: quantidade m√°xima de gifs na fila (default value is 10)
      separator: ":", // Optional: separator between the user and the message (default value is :)
    };
    const twitch_giphy = new TwitchGiphy(options);
  });
</script>
```
